## Rank your 5 most favorite and 5 least favorite support tasks. 


### Favorite:
**Manage a support team**

Working in the support field for 10+ years, I have found that the collaborations between team members to be a large part of the success that we can achieve together. Fostering those relationships is something I enjoy doing whether that is in a management capacity or as a Senior level engineer. 

**Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case**

I will often create simple video walk throughs for users that I am helping. I think that most users find a visual walk through to be the easiest way to understand complex issues.


**Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers**

When taking customer feedback and working directly with the engineering team, you can both see the interesting technical decisions needed to solve the problem as well as satisfaction from the customer knowing that that their idea was valuable.

**Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project**

I am fascinated at the creativity that users have in their projects. Seeing those details, working with the user and unblocking them creates a relationship that is beneficial to both sides.

**Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub**

Being part of a great product, receiving direct feedback from users is incredibly valuable. This feedback can help resolve issues that some users might not report, ensuring they continue to benefit from the evolving product without encountering blocks in their projects, thus reducing the risk of churn.


### Least: 
**Respond to 25+ support requests via email every day**

Any role will have periods of high volume and a Support Engineer will need to respond as such, but working with unique tickets can lead to better longterm satisfaction.

**Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent**

I believe the individual tone from each Support Engineer is valuable, as long as our code of conduct is clearly defined.

**Find and recruit teammates for the support team**

I have not had experience recruiting in the past and my network may be limited in that capacity. Though I would find working directly with potential team mates to be enjoyable.

**Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use**

Manually doing this retroactively, I believe this would be a bit tedious, though sometimes necessary. I believe it's an engineer's position to keep abreast of new issues and how they are relating to each other in real time. I would consider looking into many of the new AI tools that may be able to report on new trends. 

**Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team**

Though maybe not the flashiest option, there is value in making sure that everyone is able to take the time they need and making sure the team is operating at its best.

### What do you want to learn or do more of at work?

When I approach the role of a Support Engineer, I like to lead each day with curiosity. If one day I am working with debug logs and the next I'm digging deeper into a new language, those are the "north-star" days.

### Describe how you solved a challenge or technical issue that you faced in a previous role (preferably in a previous support role). How did you determine that your solution was successful?

At a previous role at Replit, I was the main customer facing technical resource for the deployments part of the product. I often was receiving and collecting reports, reproducing and escalating a reproduction of the issue at hand. From that point, I would work directly with development, with continuous updates to the user, until the issue was deployed into production. 

I judged these interactions to be successful as the customer was given proper expectations and received appropriately continuous feedback.

### When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?

A user would use an edge function because they are fast, scalable solution for providing content to users. Edge functions are deployed globally and best used when immediate response is needed. For example: OAuth callbacks or responding to webhooks.

A Serverless function are designed to execute functions server side, but without the user overhead of maintaining infrastructure. These functions are also stateless and event driven. If any information needs to persist between function calls, a database will need to be used.

Our Edge Middleware feature allows you to run code before a request is completed. For example: You could analyze incoming traffic before hitting your backend or implement A/B testing on a newly designed website. Edge Middleware is run from the Edge and therefore these tests operate with the highest speed and allow for greater utility for our users.

### Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better?

I would start by googling basics of the language and then I would reach out internally to see if anyone could provide context to the question. Once I felt like I was on enough of a sure foot, I would ask the user the necessary questions to provide as much context as possible. An example of this might be:  Could you provide step by step instructions on how to reproduce the issue and the output that you are expecting but not receiving?

Depending on the ticket, I would make notes internally to help address tickets about that framework in the future for myself and other engineers to use as a guide.

### The customer from question 5 replies to your response with the below:
>“I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just can’t figure it out. It must be a platform issue so just fix it for me instead of asking me questions.”
> Please write a follow-up reply to the customer.

Thank you for reaching out to us about your issue. I have tried to recreate the issue on my end but I am unable to at this time and it looks like we have not received other tickets about the same issue. 

 Would it be possible to enable more detailed logging in your app and once we determine the exact place that it is failing, I will take another look and try to reproduce the problem. This will let me confirm if it is an issue on our end and escalate as necessary. In the meantime, if you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

### A customer writes in to the Helpdesk asking "How do I do a redirect from the /blog path to https://example.com?" Please write a reply to the customer.

The easiest method is using a service side redirect. Two common services are Apache and Nginx and the following are code examples: 

Apache: 

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    Redirect "/blog" "https://example.com"
</VirtualHost>
```

Nginx:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    location /blog {
        return 301 https://example.com;
    }
}
```

Do not forget to restart the service after updating the configs in order for it reload the new code and begin the redirect. If you should have any additional questions, please let us know.

### A customer is creating a site and would like their project not to be indexed by search engines. Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about your decision making process after the reply.

Thank you for contacting Vercel with your question. Your Vercel preview deployment will NOT be indexed because a `X-Robots-Tag` is set to `noindex` by default. You can read about this more [here](https://vercel.com/guides/are-vercel-preview-deployment-indexed-by-search-engines)

The easiest way to stop indexing on your production deployment is to include a `robots.txt` file in your root directory with the following: 

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

This stops all User-agents from scanning anything in the root directory and below. 

An alternative way is to add a single tag to each page: 

```
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```

I hope this answers your questions. If you should have any other questions or issues, please do not hesitate to ask.

Elchert Note: I first did a search in the Vercel documentation to see if this was a simple educational ticket. We have a preview deployment doc, but production is not mentioned. They may have specific requirements, but this should work in most cases.

### What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?

I  believe that the biggest issues would be getting users to build their projects and deploy them without any issues.
In the short term you could collect the most common questions and either respond within the ticket to an FAQ or point them to our documentation where the FAQ could live. 

One long term solution is to collect the most common issues, develop the documentation as above, but also work with development to reduce the likely hood of the problem surfacing. What do all these cases have in common? Is there something in the UI that we could update to surface the issue to the users (and suggest a correction) before a ticket is created? Collecting user stories allows for better insights for UI and architectural changes.

### How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise?

I found the Support tasks to be the most difficult because each of these tasks are something I consider bedrock Support Engineer tasks.
